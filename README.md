# Scientific-Computing-Course-Projects
Solutions of the main projects of the course Scientific Computing held by Prof. Robert NÃ¼rnberg (UniTN, 2022). The submissions for this course projects were individual.

### Project 2: Pattern-recognition-in-DNA-sequences.
Our aim was matching patterns in real world DNA sequences, in particular I had to apply the algorithms to the genomic sequences of escherichia coli bacterium and human chromosome 21. To handle this task, I implemented an abstract data structure that represents the infixes of the genomic sequences modelled on a quaternary tree. In my repo you can find my code and report, where I briefly discussed the algoritmical complexity of the method and compare my intuition with real tests made on my laptop.

### Project 3: ODE-with-multigrid-mehods.
In this project I applied the theory seen during the course in the field of numerical resolution of Ordinary Differential Equations. In particular, the task required the use of multigrid methods for the resolution of one and two dimensional ODEs. In the report of the project there are considerations and data about the efficiency of the algorithm and my approximation of the solutions are represented as functions and surfaces' plots. I also included the original assignment where the tasks of the project are exposed and the documentation from the notes of the course regarding the relevant topics for this work.
